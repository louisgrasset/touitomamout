## Define environment variables
3 types of environment variables are required to run the sync:
- **Core variables**: required in situations, get them [here](/docs/resources/environment-variables#core-variables)
- **Sync variables**: required for the sync **you** want, get them [here](/docs/resources/environment-variables#synchronization-)
- **Manual sync variables**: required for the manual sync, get them [here](/docs/resources/environment-variables#configuration-with-manual-sync-)
