# ⏲️ PM2 configuration

## Installation
<SectionPullInstallProject/>

## Define environment variables
3 types of environment variables are required to run the sync:
- **Core variables**: required in situations, get them [here](/docs/resources/environment-variables#core-variables).
- **Sync variables**: required for the sync **you** want, get them [here](/docs/resources/environment-variables#synchronization-).
- **PM2 variables**: required for the PM2 instance, get them [here](/docs/resources/environment-variables#configuration-with-pm2-).

<TipFileGenerator />

Once your env variables are ready, inject them in a .env.[handle_to_sync] file. (e.g: `.env.signalapp`)

## Run it!

Touitomamout comes with a script that will automatically handle the PM2 instances management for you.

Simply run the following command, and all your `.env.[handle_to_sync]` files will be used by PM2 to create a dedicated Touitomamout instance for each.

```bash
npm run pm2
```

:::info I upgraded the project to the latest version, what should I do?
If you upgrade the project, you will need to update the PM2 instance(s) to use the latest version of the project. But that's as quick as running the following command:
```bash
npm run pm2:update
```
